Starter project of The Odin Project, hereby known as TOP.

I started TOP again, as I really desired working with software again from a fufillment standpoint. Granted, I still remembered most of the basics of webdev, minus certain ideas floating about. You can see this in my HTML/CSS styling, that was one area I've always lacked in.

Creating my React/JS code was never an issue, I picked it up pretty easily.

This project is a basic version of a CV Application creator, input some fields, and watch as React spits them out as components in real time onto an HTML CV.

One of my biggest struggles while re-learning JS, React and toying around with HTML CSS was definitely the idea of components. What I really wanted to add to the project was an 'Add Another x' Button, that will add another Education or Experience Area to input onto the resume. I had an inkling of an idea on how to do so, but I wanted to learn more about State and how/when I SHOULD be using them before implementing it. I thought the most important piece is to not get stuck and perfect one project, and instead get it out there and functional. It's not about being perfect, it's about learning what each project can teach, and improving from there.

Lessons learned:

React Components
Relearning HTML/CSS basics
Structure of the DOM, and how React Renders the DOM and when


Lessons that I need to re-up on:

Clean code, alot of times my components are messy, I actually revised the project because I did not like it enough. Even then, my organization leaves alot to be desired.

CSS. Alot of CSS... My styling leaves MUCH to be desired.

Functions inbuilt into JS objects, like map. I kept reading around on how I may re-render the DOM with new components from React, and alot suggested the use of .map or .filter, which iterates on arrays in JS. Unfortunately, none of my objects make use of arrays, or at least, the one's the user inputs into. Too much time to put into a project, when I can just fiddle around with React and apply these principles to the next project.


Overall pretty fun, really enjoyed making the React components, but dreaded HTML/CSS styling. Can't wait until I get into the Backend portions with Node and implementing any sort of Database interactions.
